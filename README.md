# Machine Learning Algorithms Evaluation

## Overview

The objective is to implement and evaluate core machine learning algorithms, including:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Ensemble Methods** (Boosting and Bagging)

The project includes experimentation with various configurations, comparison of results, and analysis of performance using classification metrics.

## Features

1. **KNN Implementation**:
   - Experiments with three distance metrics: Euclidean, Manhattan, and Cosine.
   - Cross-validation for optimal K (number of neighbors).

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - Models trained with different regularization techniques (L1, L2).

3. **Support Vector Machines**:
   - Exploration of kernels: linear, polynomial, and RBF.

4. **Ensemble Methods**:
   - Implementation of Boosting (AdaBoost) and Bagging (Random Forest).
   - Comparison of ensemble methods with individual models.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score
   - ROC-AUC
